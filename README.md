## Functional Numerical Algorithms
The purpose of this repository is to explore the convergence of numerical algorithms by writing them in a purely functional style. 

The following clustering algorithms will be implemented:
- [x] K-Means

The following optimization algorithms will be implemented:
- [x] Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of a univariate non-linear function
- [ ] Newton-Raphson method for finding roots of a multivariate non-linear function
